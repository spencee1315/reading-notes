# This is my notes from CODE-102 class 6 on Computer Architecture and Logic

This is notes taken from watching a selection of videos from Code.org.

## My 3 Most Significant Takeaways from watching the videos

1. All computers no matter how simple or complex all are based on the same fundamental goal - how to create a thinking machine:

 - All computers do the same 4 things:
    - Take Input
    - Store Info
    - Process It
    - Output Results

- Old Computers used to be made out of *Wood & Metal* with mechanical levers and gears

- In 20th century, electrical components started to be used but the size was massive; the size of a room for simple math / basic calculators.

- Modern Computers no matter how complex of a device, still do the same 4 things.

**A closer look at the Big 4**
- Input - the stuff we do, that tells the computer what to do. Camera, Keyboard, Finger(touch screen), heart beat (apple watch), What the car is doing

- Storage - they store information as data

- Processing - they take the stored information and do something with it, send it back to storage until it is ready to be used --> Output

- Output 
    - Ex. - Text, Photos, Videos, Games, VR, Robots
    - When computers connect the output of one computer becomes the input of another & vice-versa


1. Ones & Zeros

**How do you store or represent information with electricity?**

- With one wire:
    - You can execute one of two choices aka a ***BIT***
    - On or Off
    - Yes or No
    - True or False

- Bit - smallest piece of information a computer can store
    - With more wires you cann add more bits, with more bits you can represent more complex information

- THe Binary Number System
    - Decimal System - 0-9
        - Each position in a number has a different value
        - 1, 10, 100, 1000
    - Binary - 0 or 1
        - 1, 2, 4, 8
        - Ex. the number 9 in decimal system is, 1 0 0 1 in binary
        - Add the value: (1x8) + (0x4) + (0x2) + (1x1)
    - Any number can be represented by 1's and 0's
-All about the number of wires:
    - 8 wires = #0 - 285
    - 32 wires = #0 - 2billion

**What about other types of information?**
- Text
- Images
- Sound
- All can be represented by numbers

- **Text in binary**
- All letters in the alphabet can be represented by a number. A paragraph / letter is a series of numbers / on & off. Every system uses a method similar to this.

- **Photos, videos, graphics scene on a screen:**
- Pixels - each has a color that can be represented by numbers.
Consider:
    - Millions of pixels per image
    - 30 images per second
    - +3 billion pixels per minute
    - A lot of data

- **Sounds**
- Are vibrations in the air. 
- Can be represented by a waveform. Any point on the waveform can be represented by a number
- Sound can be then broken down into a series of numbers

- More BITS, higher quality sound:
    - If you want higher quality audio, you'd choose 32 BIT over 8 BIT audio

- If you want to understand how a computer work it all comes down to understanding 1's and 0's and the electrical currents that help them function.

1. The Art From and Power of Circutry -

- Circuits: the backbone of processing
    - Processing input & Output
        - To do this a PC has to modify & combine input singles.
        - To do this a pc uses millions of electronic components that come together as a circuit

How does a circuit do this?
Examples of curcuits:
- Curcuit NOT - Takes an electrical input/signal and flips it
- Curcuit AND - more complicated circuits can take multiple signals, this one combine them and give you a different result. 0+1=0, only gives you a one if you get both 1+1=1
- Curcuit ADDER - adds signals together. 0+0 = 00, 0+1 = 01, 1+1 = 10
    -can put together multiple adders to add larger numbers
    - Ex. 8 BIT adder - each number is represented by 8 BITs - 16 different electrical signals that go into the circuit. There are many adders in this that together calculate the sum.
- Complex computers are just lots and lots of simple circuits/operation all put together

**Speed**
- Back in the day an 8 Bit adder could be the size of a fridge and slow.
- **What makes smaller faster?**
- Smaller the size of and way faster - smaller the curcuit the less distance the electrical impulses have to travel. Signal moves at the speed of light.
