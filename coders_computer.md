## Topic 1 - Choosing A Text-Editor

1. **What is a text editor?**
A text editor is a piece of software that allows you to write and manage text. Some text editors you can download and install on your computer, others you can access online through your web browser.

1. **What are some key features & their associated benefits to consider when choosing a text editor?**
* *Code completion* - saves you time by providing a choice, rather than allowing you to finish typing and possibly encounter typos.
* *Emmet* - it's a kind of short hand that allows you to write your HTML and CSS more efficiently. Some editors have it built in, others as an extension.
* *Syntax highlighting* - is a feature that makes the text you write more noticeable by colorizing the text and changing the color based on if it's an attribute or element. It also makes it easier to find errors as the text is easier to read. 
* *Themes* - allow you to change the color of the background, text, and can sometimes affect other aspects of your text editing software.
** A popular theme choice: dark background and bright colored text. It can be easier on the eyes/reduce eye strain and fatigue.
* *Extensions* - i.e.,'Work Smarter not Harder' you want a text editor that will allow you to accomplish more with less effort. Choosing a text editor that will grow as you grow.

### Text Editors vs IDEs
* Text Editor - a text editor manages text and files, and allows you to edit text.
* IDE (Integrated Development Environment) - is a software bundle; text editor, file manager, compiler, and debugger.

1. **Why is it important as a software developer to be thoughtful when choosing the text editor to use to write code?**
Per 'The Older Coder'
> Choosing a text editor ends up being a very personal choice, as personal as the sports teams you support.

* Choosing the right text editor is about giving yourself the features to help you be more efficient in your work and allow you to grow. Ideally the right text editor will grow with you and continue to push you further. For the most part the different text editors seem pretty similar. It seems simple but the best text editor might be the one that 'feels' the best to use or that you enjoy using most.
