# About GitHub

## Git -

**It is about Sharing Code and Collaboration**

***What exactly is Git?***

	- It's a version control system
	- It lets multiple developers to work on the same code
	- A history of changes to your files
	- The ability to view, apply, and remove those changes
	- Keep all of your project files in one repository

***Without Version Control System*** 

	- One folder with multiple files in the same folder with slight name changes, being tracked
	- Git manages this version

***It uses a commit***

	- Commits represent each successive version of a file or files
	- Each successive version creates a new snapshot on the timeline of the project
	- Vc allows us only one file but we can still go back and review previous versions. Manages the changes along the way
	- Each commit snaphot has a label that points to it
	- HEAD = the label meaning 'you are here' (the most recent version)
	- You can also assign messages to commits
	- Messages are like writing a caption for your snapshot

***Summary of GIT***

	- You use git to take snapshots of your code at points in time
	- Git keeps a history of what those snapshots look like
	- Git has a special label, called HEAD, tat means "You Are Here"
	- Usually you give a snapshot a label called a message

***What About GitHub?***
