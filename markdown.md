# What is Markdown?
> Markdown is a lightweight markup language for generating html files. It uses text symbols to create page structure and you can control the display of the document by formatting words in different ways by using non-alphabetic characters like ``x`` or ``*``.

## Examples

> Headers, sized 1 - 6
>> # level 1
>> ## level 2
>> ### level 3
>> #### level 4
>> ##### level 5
>> ###### level 6

> Paragraphs
* Keeps Paragraphs Left-Aligned
* For Linebreaks use 'trailing whitespace' or the ``<br>`` html tag.
** **Be Careful** You can use two or more spaces for line breaks ***BUT*** it is controversial because it is *hard to see trailing whitespace in an editor*
   Fortunately, there is another option supported by nearly every Markdown application: the <br> HTML tag.
   
> Cool Things Can be done with blockquotes and lists

1. Ordered list line 1
2. Ordered list line 2
3. Ordered list line 3
>> Blockquotes can exist here too
